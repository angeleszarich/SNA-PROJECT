# Hollywood Elitism: the social network of the film industry
Sna2 Final Project - Mia K. Bellemare, Angie Zarich, Tara rafaty and Kanami Konishi

## Introduction

The Hollywood film industry is known for its glamorous world of movies and celebrities, where actors often work together in multiple films, forming a web of connections and close personal relationships. But how many of the opportunities and film collaborations come from use of personal connections rather than talent?

Our team has decided to focus on the role of elitism and potential nepotism in Hollywood by analysing the network of connections among the actors of the top-rated movies in the decade spanning from 2010 to 2019. In this analysis, we aim to explore the role of personal connections within opportunities in the film industry from the viewpoint of social network analysis, taking into account Granovetter‚Äôs theory of the strength of weak ties (1973), and Milgram‚Äôs small world problem (1967). We begin by taking our data from the most popular public online film rating database, IMDb, by scraping the data of the top 50 films from the decade spanning from 2010-2019. From there we created a social network of the actors involved in said films, utilising the shared films as their connections within the network. By doing so, and obtaining other social network analyses metrics, we could understand where actors lied within this network of the most prestigious films of the decade, and whether there were certain patterns observed. By examining these connections, we seek to answer the question: how well connected are the top-rated films' actors? Overall, we hope that our analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the Hollywood elitism, the relationships among Hollywood's top actors and how they contribute to the success of top-rated films.


## Hypotheses

From reviewing the literature and our initial contextual knowledge of the industry, we developed hypotheses before analysing the data: 

   üîç Actors featured higher rated films will be more connected and important in the network than those in lower-rated films

   üîç Actors in high-rated films are more likely to be featured in other top-rated films due to their connections within the industry.

   üîç The social network will have a diameter <6

Generally, we believe that we will find that the ranking the film that an actor is in will be proportional to their importance in the social network, meaning that their role within facilitating ties between actors will be high. We also believe to find that the actors within the highest rated films will be more likely to be present in other high rated films. The elitism and preference for actors who have already performed in high-rated pictures due to their established personal connections is our reason for this assumption. Finally we believe the social network will have a diameter less than 6 as presumed by Milgram (1967), and also due to the fact that the individuals we aim to analyse share a career path and therefore have a high probability of being connected.


## Methodology

In order to discover the social network of actors within top rated films, we utilised data from ‚ÄòIMDb‚Äô (Internet Movie Database). This choice was made as it is the most popular form of online film ranking and therefore would have the most accurate data for us to analyse. We utilised the 50 top ranked films, by number of audience votes, from the decade of 2010-2019. Rather than looking at the 50 top rated movies of all time, we focused our analysis simply on one 10 year time span in order to increase the probability of the actors having ties; the likelihood that the actors from a top rated film from 1980 are connected to the actors from a film made in 2020 is quite unlikely due to generational differences and the changing landscape of the film industry and it therefore could mess with our analysis.

Our simple four step methodology was as follows:

1. Scrape the data of movie titles and 5 main actors of each film
2. Set the actors as nodes and movies as edges within our social network
3. Create social network visualisation with data
4. Find social network analysis statistics and create other graphed visualisations


The data was scraped in python using the BeautifulSoup package in conjunction with headers and user agents in order to bypass the IMDb bot anti-scraping measures put in place. Once the data was extracted, we created an interactive social network visualisation graph utilising networkx and Sigma. We set each actor as a node within the network and each movie as an edge in order to see how the movies connected the actors.

After creating our initial visualisation, we again used networkx in order to get the betweenness centrality, degree centrality and, and clustering coefficient for each actor, as well as the diameter of the network. Each is defined as the following:


**Betweenness centrality** : The number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes within the network that pass through the node. Measure of the importance of the node in facilitating communication.

**Degree centrality**: The number of edges connected to a node divided by the total number of edges in the network. A measure of how well connected a node is in a network.

**Clustering coefficient**: Measure of how tightly clustered a node‚Äôs neighbours are in a network.

**Diameter**: The maximum distance between any two nodes in a network.

By obtaining the above statistics we could meaningfully analyse our network and gain a deeper understanding in the most well-connected actors and the characteristics of the network as a whole.

Relationship between Node degree and Betweennes Centrality


## Analysis
The aim of our research was to explore whether top rated actors are the most well connected in the film industry. To do this we looked at the top 50 rated films on IMDb, based on the number of votes, released between 2010/01/01 and 2019/12/31. Each film consists of a list of 4 or 5 ‚Äústars‚Äù, who serve as the lead actors, and thus from the data we extracted their names to construct the nodes of our network. Each node is connected through a movie title, serving as the edge of the network. 

### General results 
<img width="223" alt="graph 2 " src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130977477/233947603-4c526193-3192-4d58-af71-bdd19e2789bc.png">

First of all from the visualization of the social network, we were able to analyze the overall structure of the industry. As the graph shows, there is one prominent cluster, which consists of most of the actors in the network. From this we can understand that in general, actors from top rated movies are connected with one another through a large network, although the diameter of the clustered network identifies that those ties may not be strong. This contradicts with the ‚Äúsix degrees of separation"[^1]. theory which suggests that any two individuals in the world can be connected through a network of no more than six intermediaries. One reason that could lead to this result is the fact that the interaction between actors is not very fluid; it takes an average of 4 to 5 years to produce 1 film. Thus considering how the data we scraped was only from a span of 10 years, we can predict that actors did not have enough time to appear in many films, which would explain why many of them are not strongly tied with one another. 

 On the other hand, the other actors that do not belong to that cluster are mostly only connected to actors that they filmed the same movie with. However it is not necessarily the case that those actors are from the films rated very low in the list. For example, although the actors are isolated from the others, films such as ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù (2016) and "Intouchables‚Äù (2011) are respectively ranked 12th and 20th, which is not a low rank out of 50. This could be because the social network of actors is not a homogeneous group, and there may be subgroups or clusters within the network that are more tightly connected than others. In the case of "Intouchables,‚Äù it is a French produced film, making it less likely for its actors to be connected with other mainstream Hollywood actors. Yet it is true that actors that starred in any movie above rank 11, belong in the large clustered network, indicating the possibility of actors in high rated films to be more likely to be featured in other top rated films due to their personal connections within the industry.

Leonardo DiCaprio has the highest betweenness centrality, which means he is the most important node in the network. This makes sense given that he has been in a number of high-profile films and has worked with many of the other actors on the list.

### Some Specific Actors and clustering coefficient
 
Looking at the clustering coefficients provided, we can see that some actors have very high clustering coefficients of 1.0, indicating that all of their neighbours are connected to each other as well. For example, Gary Oldman, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, etc.

On the other hand, some actors have lower clustering coefficients, indicating that their neighbors are not as tightly connected to each other. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio has a clustering coefficient of 0.137, while Matthew McConaughey has a clustering coefficient of 0.429. Scarlett Johansson has a clustering coefficient of 0.619, while Robert Downey Jr. has a clustering coefficient of 0.327.

### Some Specific Actors and degree centrality
 
Looking at the degree centrality values provided, we can see that Leonardo DiCaprio has the highest degree centrality value of 0.116, indicating that he is the most connected actor in the network. Other highly connected actors include Chris Evans with a value of 0.090 and Robert Downey Jr. with a value of 0.071. These actors are likely to be important in the network due to their high number of connections.
